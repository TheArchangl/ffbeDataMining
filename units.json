Feeling safe in his care, she eventually developed feelings for the monk. However, he had his own goals and dreams to realize, and thus left her to accomplish them, never to return.

Trust Moogles are so rare that they may turn heads even within the moogle community itself, so to encounter one is considered quite auspicious. Trust Moogles do not search for these special crystals as a hobby, nor even as part of their training, but as the foremost task of their very purpose in life: to strengthen the bonds between people. Thus, should they encounter someone worthy of receiving a crystal, they will hand it over freely and without qualm.",
